# Discord Rich Presence for TIDAL
This is a simple program that allows you to show what you're listening to on TIDAL on Discord.

This implementation uses .NET code via the [edge.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/edge-js) library to scrape the main window title, which it then uses to call the TIDAL API and get basic info about your song, as well as the album cover. <br />

macOS and Linux support is _not_ guaranteed, but it should work on those platforms as well, provided that the TIDAL main window behaves the same as the Windows client.
